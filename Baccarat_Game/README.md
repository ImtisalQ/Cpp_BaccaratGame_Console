BACCARAT Game
=============

Baccarat is a casino card game and is played between two parties none of which is the gambler. The game is played between a "Banker" and a "Player". The Gambler bets its amount on the outcome of the game. This means the gambler can either bet on "Player Win", "Banker Win" or a "Draw".

The Game is played according to following rules:
-----------------------------------------------
1. The cards 2-9 of any suit holds their numeric value. E.g, 2 of hearts has the value 2, 5 of clubs has the value 5 etc.
2. Ace holds the value 1 and face cards holds the value 0.
3. The Player and Banker each draw two cards at random from the deck of cards. The aim of the game is to have the sum of these cards as close to 9 as possible. There are some scenarios where a third card is also drawn from either the Player, Banker or both and it depends on the individual values of the drawn cards. The details of these scenarios are explained in detail in the following Youtube video.

4. The sum of the cards is always kept under 10 by taking a modulo of 10 if the sum goes over 9. In simple words, whenever we have a value higher than 9, we will drop the tens part of it. E.g, 15 becomes 5 and 10 becomes 0.
5. Since the aim is to have a sum close to 9, a sum of either 8 or 9 automatically qualifies as a win. If in the rare case it happens with both banker and player simultaneously then it is a Draw.
6. The game is also a Draw if sum of both the Player and the Banker is same.
